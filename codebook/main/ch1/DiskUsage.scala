// Here we want you to implement an utility that counts a disk space usage for
// given directory, including all nested files/directories. The program should
// have command line interface. It should accept a directory which size will be
// counted as the only command line argument. If there's no parameter given, the
// program should count disk usage for the current directory. If it is not
// possible to read the file, the program should print an error message with
// their name on the `stdin`.
