The Word Counter 
================

You should write your own implementation of the famous and legendary unix utility. It should answer the following commands: 

     wc -c <filename> prints the byte count 
     wc -l <filename> prints the line count
     wc -m <filename> prints the character count
     wc -w <filename> prints the word count
     wc -L <filename> prints the length of the longest line 

We encourage you to use scala.io.Source and recursion when it's possible. The utility should be built as a jar file, by scala build tool:. Please cover parts of your code with ScalaTest. It has a huge variety of Spec types. You may choose any suitable for you. 

## Methodical purpose:
The goal of this project is to introduce the foundations of the language and it's de-facto standard build tool to students alongside with the most used testing framework: ScalaTest. We encourage using functional approach. During this project students are going to implement something they know and already familiar with. Something they can touch in real life. That should be fun and stressless.
